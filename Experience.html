                <b>1. International Non-Voice Customer Support — Ecombirds</b>
                <br>
                <b>Office-based | Customer Support | 2025</b>
                <br><br>
                I worked as a non-voice customer support executive where I handled queries from international clients. Most of my work involved replying professionally, solving basic issues, and keeping track of customer requests. I regularly used tools like Skype, Outlook, Gmail, Sheets, ChatGPT, and Copilot to manage communication and information.
                <br>
                I also interacted directly with foreign customers through chat, making sure their concerns were understood and responded to clearly.

                <b>2. Logo Design — Freelance</b>
                <br><br>
                I created five logos for a company named “Pentagram.” Although I later realized the company wasn’t genuine, the work helped me gain early experience in understanding client requirements and designing simple brand concepts.
